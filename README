= other modules required = 
- entity api module is required.
- include/patternentity.admin.inc row 53-64 need patterns, patterns_xmlparser, patterns_yamlparser. 
	- rewrite these 12 rows can make patternentity module Independent of patterns, patterns_xmlparser, patterns_yamlparser; but instead, patternentity will depend on libraries module and I need to add validation code on the existence of spyc&codomirror library.
- token is actually required by Patterns module, it's not required by this module.
